# OpenCV 3.0 NDK Starter Project

A simple hello world application in which the OpenCV 3 API is accessed via native C++ code. 
Different than most other starter projects, this configuration doesn't need any absolute paths to be set for compiling and is therefore quite flexible.

Tested with Android Studio 2.2.2.
